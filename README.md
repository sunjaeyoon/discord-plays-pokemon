# discord-plays-pokemon
A spinoff of the ChatPlaysPokemon using Discord as the sharing platform

# How it works
This implementation makes use of NodeJS and Python.
Python will require pyautogui
NodeJs will require discord.js

Download an emulator for GBA and set it as the default window
You can then invite people to your discord channel to play any gba game
together as a team.

To start the program use node bot.js
*There is a python3.9 version of the code that also runs the same
thing -> python py39discord.py
